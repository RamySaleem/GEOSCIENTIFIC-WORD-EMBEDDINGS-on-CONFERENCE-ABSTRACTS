## Introduction

This study was created on the framework of understainding how the natural lanuages processing can help in geosciences. The project aims to investigate a set of geosciences word embeddings and identify the most similar term to five given terms. Moreover, calculate the nearest term to a vector calculation problem. These terms were Salt, Ghost, Gather, and elastic. The vector calculations computed were P-wave - compressional plus shear, seal - mudstone plus sandstone, PSTM -time plus depth and finally Kirchoff - ray plus wavefield.

## Dataset
The data is composed of summaries of geoscience conference abstracts and journal papers. The data was loaded using a token as an environment variable.
