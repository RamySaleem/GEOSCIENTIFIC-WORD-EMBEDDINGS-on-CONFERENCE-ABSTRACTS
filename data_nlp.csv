While the acquisition design in the context of seismic imaging applies criteria like fold, offset and spatial sampling, different attributes such as the sensitivity kernels are more relevant for seismic full waveform inversion. An ideal measure to quantify the goodness of an acquisition design relies on the eigenvalue spectrum of the approximate Hessian matrix, but this technique is computationally too expensive for practical use. A more affordable goodness measure has been proposed in the past, but we demonstrate that this measure is inappropriate for target‐oriented optimized experimental design. To address those issues, we derived a sequential receiver‐based procedure using a goodness measure based on the determinant of the approximate Hessian matrix. We show with numerical tests that it efficiently provides an optimized design for target‐oriented as well as for extensive full waveform inversion. This design allows a better reconstruction of the subsurface than an evenly spaced acquisition geometry. Furthermore, the optimization algorithm itself can easily be parallelized, therefore making it attractive for applications to large‐scale three‐dimensional surveys.

The speed of the increase (for the same pore volume injected) depends on matrix porosity, velocity of the front, fracture spacing and permeability contrast.    The molecules of the injected gas are diffusing into the matrix while the components of the reservoir gas are diffusing towards the fracture. The various components have different diffusion coefficients.

If the mass transfer was solely based on diffusion, oil recovery would have been unacceptably slow. The success of this method therefore depends on the degree of enhancement of the mass exchange rate between the solvent residing in the fracture and the oil residing in the matrix.  A series of soak experiments have been conducted to investigate the mass transfer rate between the fracture and the matrix. In a soak experiment, a porous medium containing oil is immersed in an open space containing the solvent to simulate the matrix and the fracture respectively. We use a CT scanner to visualize the process. The experimental data are compared with a simulation model that takes  diffusive, gravitational and convective forces into account.   Application  For oil wet conditions, injection of a liquid (waste) solvent can be considered as a possible alternative for recovery from naturally fractured reservoirs. In the absence of interfacial tension no residual phase trapping occurs. Gravity enhanced transfer leads to practical recovery rates.   Results, Observations and Conclusions  The initial stage of all experiments can be described by a diffusion-based model with an enhanced ""effective diffusion coefficients"". In the second stage enhancement of the transfer rate occurs due to the natural convection of  solvent in the fracture and its effect on the flow in the matrix. The experiments can be quantitatively mimicked by numerical simulations. We find that transfer rates depend on the properties of the rock, solvent and oil.

Upscaling of these functions, whether by steady-state methods or other techniques, typically generates a complex myriad of relative permeability curves that is challenging to handle pragmatically. This study investigates whether a three-parameter correlation of relative permeability is able to represent the saturation function for fine grid simulation models with the most common heterogeneities, coarse grid simulation models with upscaled properties in addition to verify two-phase core-flow experiments.  To demonstrate the applicability of two flexible three-parameter correlations at the field simulation scale, we have utilized three synthetic fine-scale models with the most common heterogeneities: a severe thief zone, upward coarsening and downward coarsening. All simulation cases use a down-dip water injector and an up-dip oil producer. Excellent matches are obtained by history matching on the parameters of the coarse grid correlations in all cases.  The flexibility of the correlations will, opposed to the restricted single-parameter Corey representation, enable a versatile, pragmatic and satisfactory upscaling for coarse grid blocks when used in combination with any well-known upscaling method. The benefit is a limited number of parameter arrays as opposed to numerous rather inconvenient tables. The proposed parametric representation of upscaled relative permeability is applicable to immiscible recovery methods in general.

The software described here helps engineers to identify perforating jobs that have a risk of gunshock related damaged, such as bent tubing and unset packers.

Gauge pressure data shows that predicted wellbore pressure transients are accurate both in magnitude and time. Peak sustained pressure amplitudes at the gauges are on average within 10% of software simulated values, both for gun underbalanced and gun overbalanced conditions. For cases where shock absorbers were used, residual deformations of crushable elements correlate well with the peak axial loads predicted by the software.

One way to accomplish this is to use multifunctional additives that can improve several slurry properties at the same time without significant detrimental effects on other required properties.    Towards this end, a modified cellulose-based polymer has been tested according to API recommended practices in various cement slurries and was identified to have multiple benefits in addition to be environmentally friendly: The test results demonstrate that this single additive controls fluid loss better than commonly used fluid loss additives at temperatures up to 80(degree)C while also controlling free fluid and performing as an extender.

In this paper, the effect of various petro-physical parameters like porosity and permeability on CBM production has been estimated by considering a real world dataset. The changes in the gas production rate with time have been illustrated considering a range of reservoir parameters. It has been found that the change in permeability with constant porosity greatly affects the production rates with permeability being directly proportional to the rate of gas production. The change in porosity with constant permeability also affects the production of the gas by reducing the production rate with increased porosity since the higher amount of water in the pores now hinders the flow rate of the adsorbed gas.

The fractured basement reservoirs are much more difficult and expensive to evaluate when compared to a conventional reservoir due to its challenging environment. Many new technology tools are target s for such reservoirs. However, the optimized formation evaluation program is required to obtain as much reservoir information to enable an estimation of the most prospective hydrocarbon bearing intervals in this reservoir. This information is essential for field development decision in fractured basement reservoirs. This paper presents the challenges and results of the formation evaluation program in the fractured basement reservoir in Malaysia. This particular well example is a highly-deviated well drilled with oilbased mud (OBM) as it was believed that the borehole wall failures, formation damage and fracture damage which occurred in previous wells was due to being drilled with a water-based mud (WBM). Current image-based fracture evaluation techniques were developed for water-based mud systems. However, a comparatively limited fracture analysis can still be done with the Dual Oil-base MicroImager (OBMI2) in oil-based muds. There are inherent limitations that prevent interpreters from performing a full fracture analysis beyond fracture identification, orientation and fracture density quantification in OBMs. OBM makes differentiating between open and closed/healed fractures impossible as both appear as resistive events although one is filled with the OBM and the latter with resistive cement. This in turn prevents the calculation of fracture aperture and fracture porosity. This uncertainty can be fulfilled by combining the borehole image results with dual packer wireline formation tester (WFT), Sonic Scanner reflection imaging and Stoneley data. The borehole image was crucial in selecting testing zones for the dual packer WFT, and in turn the WFT results were especially helpful in determining whether fractures within a certain zone were open or healed (productive or not). Reservoir parameters and fluid sampling were obtained using the WFT. In addition, the combination of the borehole image and Stoneley was an important factor in reducing uncertainties. The Stoneley fracture analysis is intended to detect open fractures with significant fluid flow in/out of them. Also Borehole Acoustic Reflection Survey imaging delivers highresolution acoustic images around the wellbore to identify sub-seismic inter beds, faults or fractures far beyond the resolution obtained from any seismic surveys. Using a combination of data from all of these disciplines, the uncertainties of fracture analysis in OBM can be lessened and the resulting integrated solution giving significant value to the characterization of complex fractured reservoir.', 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Integrated Fracture Evaluation af a Malaysian Basement Well Drilled with the Oil-Based Mud', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': 'PGCE 2008', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:13:44.192237', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:13:44.192246'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': '905d8557-5362-4ba2-b62d-e50f2105f947'}}}"

Magnitude of the strongest seismic events in copper mines of Legnica-Glogow Copper District (LGCD) in Poland exceeds 4.0. Furthermore, due to shallow focal depth, events of this size can give rise to peak ground acceleration of more than 2 m/s2. An accurate assessment of seismic hazard posed by mining-induced events is thus a problem of primary importance. Monitoring mining seismicity in LGCD is carried on both underground as well as from the surface. The underground seismic network is supposed to provide information about seismic sources. Yearly several thousands events are recorded and parameterized. The surface accelerometric ground motion monitoring aims at assessing seismic impacts to buildings and other man-made structures in this considerably urbanized area. The mining seismic events are weak earthquakes but the seismicity in mines significantly differs from the earthquake process. Firstly, mining event occurrence is predominantly controlled by time-varying mining works, therefore the active zones in mines are, by their nature, transient. Moreover, even during their lifetime, the activity of these zones changes considerably. In our approach to seismic hazard assessment in mines, locations and times of activity of the zones that will be active in the future are deduced from programs of mining operations. Characteristics of fracturing process in these zones are inferred from characteristics of the zones that were active in the past and can be considered as models for the future activity. The model zones are selected by expert judgment based on anticipated similarity between mining and geologic conditions of the past and future zones. The epistemic uncertainty of such selections is considered within the logic tree scheme. Secondly, due to the heterogeneity of the rockmass fracturing process, the magnitude distribution of seismic events induced by exploitation is often non-Gutenberg-Richter's, complex and multimodal. As a remedy the model-free approach with the non-parametric kernel estimator of magnitude density is applied. This approach ensures reliable estimates of probability functions of event size regardless the actual complexity of the underlying distribution of magnitude.

The experimental results acclaim that (A) has high efficiency on both calcium sulfate and calcium carbonate, though (B) has more significant inhibition efficiency on calcium carbonate compared to calcium sulfate, at the similar condition of green SI dosage. Obtained scales were analyzed by filtration gravimetrical method as well as X-Ray diffraction (XRD). As it can be drawn from XRD, nearly 80% calcite and 60% gypsum would be inhibited in the absence of SI (A) using the dosage of 300 mg/L. Besides, the SI (B) inhibits 20% calcite and 10% gypsum.

The report presents a new approach and the technology of full azimuthal differential seismic facies analysis (Facies analysis versus azimuth - FACIVAZ) with the use of full-azimuth seismic data to improve the accuracy of the qualitative prediction of oil-saturated zones into fractured reservoirs. The work (First Break, Vol 37, January, 2019) showed that in the fractured or fractured-porous reservoirs, distortions in the frequency composition of the reflected signals occur due to the azimuth-dependent effects of dispersion and absorption of seismic signals in oil-saturated fractured media. These frequency distortions ultimately affect on the trace shape depending on the azimuth of each ray s pair. In the case of full-azimuth seismic exploration, using deep processing of pre-stack data in the local angle domain the change in the record trace form depending on the azimuth direction becomes especially noticeable and significant. This effects are registered in seismic record traces and are used in FACIVAZ technology for more accurate and reliable qualitative prediction of oil-saturated fractured zones into reservoirs.

One source of timeshifts originates inside the reservoir interval as a result of changes in the pore-fluid properties that alter the seismic velocity. Another is from changes in seismic velocity and layer thickness that occur both inside and outside of the reservoir as a result of reservoir compaction and stress and strain redistribution in the surrounding formations. Timeshifts induced by changes in fluid properties are always zero above the top reservoir reflection event and constant below the base of the reservoir. These fluidinduced timeshifts can be significant (for example, when gas is released as an oil passes through bubble point) and are routinely calculated using Gassmann or similar theories and are not the focus of this paper. The compaction-induced timeshifts have opposite gradients on the inside and outside of the reservoir. Within the reservoir, the reduction in layer thickness and the expected increase in seismic velocity will reduce the seismic travel time across these layers. Outside the reservoir, the decrease in reservoir thickness is exactly balanced by surface subsidence and rock expansion. The expanding overburden produces increased layer thickness and slower seismic velocities that increase the seismic travel times. Observations on real time-lapse seismic data over compacting reservoirs show that the positive timeshifts that accrue in the overburden are larger than the negative timeshifts that accrue inside the reservoir (the sign convention chosen is that positive timeshifts result when the seismic travel time increases). The amount of overburden elongation cannot exceed the amount of reservoir compaction. So if the change in velocity were simply proportional to the change in vertical strain, the reduction in travel time through the reservoir would exceed the increase in travel time though the overburden. The net effect would be a negative timeshift below the reservoir. Instead positive timeshifts are observed below compacting reservoir indicting velocity reduction per unit elongation strain significantly exceeds the velocity increase per unit contraction strain. Using simple models of the velocity-strain response it is shown that time-lapse timeshifts are proportional to the stretching of the overburden layers and that this is highly correlated with the reservoir compaction.

To produce estimates of aquifer properties (such as the spatial distribution of water content and parameters controlling the duration of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal), an inversion is required. Essential to the reliable interpretation of the estimated subsurface models is an understanding of the uncertainty and correlation between the parameters in the estimated models. To quantify parameter uncertainty and correlation in the surface nuclear magnetic resonance inversion, a Markov chain Monte Carlo approach is demonstrated. Markov chain Monte Carlo approaches have been previously employed to invert surface nuclear magnetic resonance data, but the primary focus has been on quantifying parameter uncertainty. The focus of this paper is to further investigate whether the parameters in the estimated models exhibit correlation with one another; equally important to building a reliable interpretation of the subsurface is an understanding of the parameter uncertainty. The utility of the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach is demonstrated through the investigation of three questions. The first question investigates whether the parameters describing the water content and thickness of a layer exhibit a strong correlation. This question stems from applying concepts known to electromagnetic surveys (that the layer thickness and layer resistivity parameters are strongly correlated) to the surface nuclear magnetic resonance inversion. A water content–layer thickness correlation in surface nuclear magnetic resonance would not have large effects for quantifying total water content but would affect the ability to identify layer boundaries. The second question examines whether the parameter controlling the duration of the nuclear magnetic resonance signal exhibits a correlation with the water content and layer thickness parameters. The resolution of surface nuclear magnetic resonance typically does not consider the duration of the signal and focuses primarily on the distribution of current amplitudes that form the suite of transmit pulses. It is common to treat regions with short‐duration signal with greater uncertainty, but it is important to understand whether the signal duration controls resolution for medium to long duration signals as well. The third question explores if the parameter uncertainty produced by the Markov chain Monte Carlo approach is consistent with that produced by an alternative approach based upon the posterior covariance matrix (for the linearised inversion).

Seismic images obtained during piling can give vital information about the subsurface structure in the vicinity of the pile. In this paper, we discuss how to produce seismic images as a part of the piling procedure without using any external seismic sources. Using surface and borehole synthetic data examples, we show that it is possible to use pressure (P) waves emitted from the pile tip for imaging purposes. A pilot field study was carried out to test the feasibility of this method. The field study revealed that high‐frequency pressure waves are emitted from the pile tip. However, they are masked by strong surface and shear waves, especially at the nearer offsets.

A 3D model of the Palinuro study area was created using bathymetry data, and forward modelling of the electric field diffusion was carried out using a finite volume method.

Furthermore, the vertical loop transmitter is more effective at distinguishing the seafloor conductivity structure when the vertical separation between transmitter and receiver is large due to the bathymetry. As a horizontal transmitter is logistically easier to deploy, we conducted a first test of the method with a horizontal transmitter. Apparent conductivities are calculated from the electric field transients recorded at the remote receivers.

Input data can be obtained either by direct observation (for instance in a horizontal borehole), by modelling or by a novel iterative scheme that is currently being developed. The output of interferometric redatuming can be used for imaging below the redatuming level, resulting in a so‐called interferometric image. Internal multiples from above the redatuming level are eliminated during this process. In the past, we introduced point‐spread functions for interferometric redatuming by cross‐correlation. These point‐spread functions quantify distortions in the redatumed data, caused by internal multiple reflections in the overburden. In this paper, we define point‐spread functions for interferometric imaging to quantify these distortions in the image domain. These point‐spread functions are similar to conventional resolution functions for seismic migration but they contain additional information on the internal multiples in the overburden and they are partly data‐driven.

Common‐reflection‐surface stack processing considers more traces during the stack than common midpoint processing, and the resulting image displays a better signal‐to‐noise ratio. In the last decade, the common‐reflection‐surface stack method was established as a powerful tool to provide improved images, especially for low‐fold or noise‐contaminated data.

However, for data from environments with low acoustic impedance and poor velocity information, coherence, which is automatically obtained in the optimization procedure, provides an alternative way to image the subsurface.

This method is suitable to build high‐resolution velocity models provided that the targeted area is sampled by both diving waves and reflected waves. However, the conventional formulation of full‐waveform inversion prevents the reconstruction of the small wavenumber components of the velocity model when the subsurface is sampled by reflected waves only. This typically occurs as the depth becomes significant with respect to the length of the receiver array. This study first aims to highlight the limits of the conventional form of full‐waveform inversion when applied to seismic reflection data, through a simple canonical example of seismic imaging and to propose a new inversion workflow that overcomes these limitations. The governing idea is to decompose the subsurface model as a background part, which we seek to update and a singular part that corresponds to some prior knowledge of the reflectivity. Forcing this scale uncoupling in the full‐waveform inversion formalism brings out the transmitted wavepaths that connect the sources and receivers to the reflectors in the sensitivity kernel of the full‐waveform inversion, which is otherwise dominated by the migration impulse responses formed by the correlation of the downgoing direct wavefields coming from the shot and receiver positions. This transmission regime makes full‐waveform inversion amenable to the update of the long‐to‐intermediate wavelengths of the background model from the wide scattering‐angle information. However, we show that this prior knowledge of the reflectivity does not prevent the use of a suitable misfit measurement based on cross‐correlation, to avoid cycle‐skipping issues as well as a suitable inversion domain as the pseudo‐depth domain that allows us to preserve the invariant property of the zero‐offset time. This latter feature is useful to avoid updating the reflectivity information at each non‐linear iteration of the full‐waveform inversion, hence considerably reducing the computational cost of the entire workflow.

Euler deconvolution applies only to functions that are homogeneous. This is the case for the magnetic field due to contacts, thin dikes and poles. Fortunately, many complex geological structures can be approximated by these simple geometries. In practice, the Euler equation is also solved for a background regional field. For the analytic signal, the model used is generally a contact, although other models, such as a thin dike, can be considered.

The message was that an ocean bottom node (OBN) seismic acquisition could be ‘well worth the additional expense . This was perhaps an unfortunate turn of phrase reinforcing an industry perception that seabed seismic was indeed a costly operation.  In the intervening period, according to our best estimate, OBS surveys have in fact been slowly eroding the previous dollar value market share held by towed streamers, rising from around 4% in 2006 to approximately 15% in 2015 (see Table 1).

ElectroMagnetic (EM) methods play a fundamental role in the geothermal exploration due to particular sensitivity of the subsurface electrical resistivity (hereby resistivity) to hydro¬thermal circulation, thermal regime and rocks alteration. Many papers have been published on the study of geothermal areas by EM methods worldwide (Meju, 2002; Spichak and Manzella, 2009; Muñoz, 2014 and references therein).  In this paper, we propose an updated state-of-the-art of the main electromagnetic and direct current methods for geother¬mal exploration in Italy, describing innovative case studies and including a discussion about the direction of new researches.   The Magnetotellurics (MT) represents the most common and effective method for investigating deep geothermal res¬ervoirs. A case study in southern Tuscany is herein described. We will also focus the attention on the resistivity measure¬ments for shallow geothermal exploration by means of Airborne EM (AEM), Transient or Time Domain EM (TEM or TDEM) and Electrical Resistivity Tomography (ERT).   Among the various scientific projects for geothermal exploration that the Italian National Research Council (CNR) carried out, the VIGOR project (evaluation of the geothermal potential of Regions of Convergence) for Southern Italy provided the occasion of detailed geoelectro¬magnetic studies for assessing shallow and deep geothermal resources (Manzella et al. 2013a, VIGOR website). Some cases study of the VIGOR project are briefly described as: i) the innovative application of Airborne EM data acquired over large areas in Sicily and applied to the assessment of shallow geothermal potential and ii) a Deep Electrical Resistivity Tomography (DERT) acquired on a thermal area in Calabria region.

Since the introduction around 2003 of the first modern wireless land acquisition systems (see Panel 1), the market has seen a variety of different systems introduced with a blend of different features. Over the same time, the land seismic market in North America has also undergone a remarkable transformation, whereby the traditional telemetry cable-based systems have lost their dominant position, having been overhauled by the combination of various wireless solutions.  In traditional cabled systems, the observer had a clear view of his task controlling the operation of the system. The status of the entire system was available to him in real-time, with QC data being transmitted from the field equipment via telemetry cable. He could see the condition of the batteries, and direct the crew to replace them as required; he could see with a high degree of confidence what wind or environmental noise the sensors were picking up; and above all he could immediately detect if sensors were out of specification or cables were damaged.  Thus, he had all the information necessary to acquire good quality seismic data. The Achilles  heel of the operations, of course, was the susceptibility of the telemetry cables to damage during operations and an alternative to these was long sought. The introduction of wireless systems removed the issues around cable-damage, and their success – reflected in their increasing dominance in the North American market – clearly shows that seismic contractors using them experience operational benefits in doing so.   Figure 1 gives an illustration of the change in relative market share from 2007 to 2011, and indications are that wireless systems have further increased their market share since. There are, however, a number of differences in the capabilities of the different systems available, most especially regarding their provision of QC data to the system observer. Additionally, some systems have been developed to offer some of the advantages of both cabled and wireless systems, and it is the intention in this paper to address systems according to their capabilities rather than their data transmission medium.

We have examined electrical log data from vertical exploration and appraisal wells and deviated production wells in the North Sea. By correlating the same sedimentary units between wells, we are able to compare resistivities measured at different borehole inclination angles.

The presence of fractures can be very beneficial since knowledge of their characteristics allows the design of well paths that intersect a larger number of permeable fractures, thus increasing production. It also enables optimized placement of injectors for improved sweep efficiency and better control of the reservoir pressure. However, fractures can also be damaging for the economic potential of a field. They can create preferential flow paths which may lead to premature water breakthroughs or, conversely, act as barriers to impede production. A good understanding of the fracture network in terms of intensity, orientation, and spatial distribution is therefore essential for improved reservoir development. Some fracture information is available from core observations and image log interpretation, but these data are only valid in the vicinity of the borehole, and when extrapolated beyond this, can lead to erroneous prediction of the overall reservoir dynamics. Even though geostatistical methods can help to reduce the uncertainty associated with spatial predictions by taking into account the geological heterogeneities, a true 3D attribute is necessary in order to accurately characterize a fractured reservoir. Following the observations of Crampin (1985a, 1985b), Crampin et al. (1986), Thomsen (1988), and others, it is now widely recognized that fracture systems are often found to be aligned in a preferential direction. This induces a directional (or azimuthal) dependence of seismic properties such as traveltime, velocities and reflection amplitudes. This directional dependence, also referred to as anisotropy, can cause seismic shear waves to split in preferential directions related to the alignment of the fractures: the fast shear waves being polarized parallel to the fractures and the slow shear waves polarized perpendicular to the fractures. It can also affect the amplitude of compressional waves depending on the azimuthal direction of propagation. An analysis of the anisotropy effects observed in 3D seismic data can therefore provide insight into the fracture characteristics (Thomsen, 1995; Lynn et al., 1995, 1996). Methods based on shear-wave splitting analysis are well established (Crampin, 2000), but unfortunately shear wave data are relatively expensive to acquire and process. As a result, in the last few years there has been a growing interest in P-wave azimuthal amplitude variation. Rüger and Tsvanskin (1997) demonstrated that reliable estimates of the anisotropy parameters could be obtained from the P-wave amplitude. Later, the approximations of the P-wave reflection coefficient presented by Rüger (1998) were extended into a linearized form by Jenner (2002) and used by many authors for inferring fracture properties. Angerer et al. (2003a) then went on to propose an integrated workflow for seismic fracture characterization from wide-azimuth large offset P-wave and PS data. This approach (Figure 1) includes a state-ofthe- art geostatistical decomposition technique combined with azimuthal anisotropy analysis and yields quantitative estimates of fracture intensity and direction. It can be applied either to horizon-based attributes, such as interval velocity maps and RMS amplitude maps, or to 3D attribute volumes such as seismic amplitude and AVO attributes. Here we present the results of a recent fracture characterization study based on P-wave azimuthal anisotropy from a wide-azimuth 3D land dataset. The goal of the study was to characterize the fracture distribution in a carbonate reservoir using several attributes such as interval velocities, RMS amplitude and seismic amplitude. In addition, to confirm  the validity of the estimated anisotropy attributes, this study also included an analysis of the fractures using FMI/FMS log data from six wells. Several comparisons of anisotropic and conventional processing illustrate the benefits of our approach at different stages of the processing.

In this study we demonstrate how time-lapse seismic has contributed to improving the drainage strategy at the Heidrun field and how working in integrated teams helps exploit the full potential of the methodology. We also show how Statoil s time-lapse seismic inversion procedure has improved the interpretation of intra-reservoir production changes. The Heidrun oil field was discovered in 1985 off the coast of mid-Norway (Figure 1) and has total reserves of 180 million Sm3 of oil and 41.6 billion Sm3 of gas. Approximately 107 million Sm3 of the oil have been exported since production began in 1995. Seismic monitoring is an integral part of an improved oil recovery (IOR) campaign to exploit the remaining reserves. Time-lapse seismic surveys were carried out over the southern part of the Heidrun field (Figure 1) in 2001 and 2004 (Furre et al., 2003 and 2005, respectively), the base survey stemming from 1986. The 2004 survey, however, covered a slightly larger area to gain information to the west of the production platform where an additional production well was to be drilled. The results not only provided a better understanding of the reservoir but also permitted the drainage strategy to be significantly upgraded. The Heidrun field comprises late Triassic to early/mid Jurassic fluvial, deltaic, and shallow marine sandstones of the Åre and upper Tilje formations and the overlying Fangst Group (Figure 2). The field is a heavily faulted horst block and has to be produced in general by draining separate compartments. The aim of the 2004 repeated survey was to better understand the reservoir and improve the drainage strategy for the Fangst and Upper Tilje units which were favourably disposed to time-lapse seismic because of their location and production properties. The seismic data were acquired in September 2001 and June 2004, a time difference of just less than three years (i.e. about half that compared with more than six years of production in the period between the 1986 base line survey and the 2001 repeat survey). The overall drainage strategy for the field is reservoir pressure maintenance by up-flank gas and down-flank water injection - the first row of productions wells being placed accordingly. However, time-lapse seismic was used to optimize the location of new up-flank targets as the wells started to water out. The remaining reserves for each target presently range between 0.25-0.5 million Sm3. The 2001 time-lapse seismic survey results proved valuable for locating four new production wells, while the results from the 2004 survey helped to optimize the positioning of at least one new production well and three new injection wells. The repeated seismic surveys also improved our general understanding of the field s drainage and helped to increase the knowledge of multi-disciplinary staff engaged in generating flooding maps.

The Vibtech story started quite by chance. Vibtech co-founders Bill Park and John Flavell Smith had worked together at GECO in the UK during the late 1980s and both had subsequently returned to Scotland. In 1995, Flavell Smith saw a small advertisement that Park had placed in the press looking for field personnel and called him. They arranged to meet up and that was the starting point for the Vibtech journey.  Both recognized the need to rid land and transition zone seismic systems of the messy and problematic digital cables and connectors which are responsible for huge logistical, troubleshooting and HSE issues. If this could be done, then system channel counts could increase and explorationists could concentrate once more on data quality and not on the logistics of moving massive recording systems. To achieve this, they had the idea of applying techniques from the burgeoning mobile telephone and internet markets to seismic instrumentation. Vibtech was founded to explore those ideas and the world s first Cellular Seismic acquisition system was born.  This would be the first time that a seismic acquisition system capitalized on technologies developed for other industries and integrated them into the system architecture, breaking the mould of seismic instrumentation design, which had historically used bespoke engineering solutions. The great advantage of this design philosophy was that emerging new technologies could be incorporated into the system without the need to completely re-design the system. Vibtech has constantly seized upon these opportunities to refine its systems. The huge operational benefits of cable free and light weight systems are obvious and are the holy grail for the seismic designer and operator alike. These benefits have been widely discussed previously in this publication, by Burger (2000), Jack (2003), and Heath (2004), to name a few. It is interesting to note that Vibtech s competitors have recognized that its approach to delivering a cable free system is on the right path and have recently changed their plans to follow.  Vibtech has now designed, developed, and commercialized a full-scale seismic acquisition system from the ground up, something which many have tried but few have managed. In the process, Vibtech has raised well in excess of $20 million in venture capital, built the workforce to more than 30 personnel, including an in-house R&D team of engineers, opened offices in London and Houston, and has representation in all of the major exploration regions of the world.

Shear-wave propagation is sensitive only to rigidity and density, while compressional-wave propagation is sensitive to rigidity, density and compressibility.  Interpreting both P- and S-wave reflectivity offers the ability to discriminate lithology, porosity, fractures and possibly fluid content.

In this illustrated article Gehrig Schultz and Norberto Soto describe how one PGS Onshore operation found the solution to carrying out seismic acquisition in a jungle region of Ecuador in the face of objections, local and international.   At the edge of the Amazon jungle a short flight east of the cool mountain valley where the Andean capital, Quito, sits surrounded by high snow capped peaks and a smoking volcano, PGS Onshore s Crew 360 has been busy meeting the challenge of seismic acquisition in the jungle and the special local conditions that govern such surveys. The crew is acquiring its second 3D survey in Ecuador s oil rich Oriente Basin for state oil company, PetroProduccion, as part of a project to redevelop the mature Sacha Field.  Discovery of the Sacha Field and other nearby giant fields attracted immigration to the area by poor peasants called ‘colonos  pursuing economic opportunities and free land. The colonization, in turn, led to commercial development, including logging, mining and agriculture. In Ecuador, as in any developing nation, forested lands were cleared to support this growing population.  Today, the oil boom s economic opportunities have been replaced by increasing poverty as the ‘colonos  can now only operate marginal cattle ranches and small struggling coffee, cocoa and oil palm plantations. The poor jungle soils only produced profitable crop yields for three or fours years, until minerals were depleted from the thin jungle soils. The worldwide collapse of coffee prices has eliminated the main source of income for many small farmers. Small groups of traditional indigenous tribes still inhabit the remote, undisturbed jungle areas, living very much in the way they have for centuries. Environmental damage during the early years of oil field development has led local farmers and indigenous groups to distrust the petroleum industry. This distrust led local stakeholders and international non-governmental organizations (NGOs) to actively challenge oil exploration activity in the area, with demands for reclamation of damaged areas and a share in the benefits from the production.  The biggest challenge in executing a 3D survey in Ecuador s Oriente region is operating a high quality seismic crew safely and efficiently in this complex and turbulent social environment. Evidence of the complex social environment is demonstrated by recent job delays and cancellations in the area. One major international seismic company finally declared force majeure on a project and closed its Ecuadorian operation after repeated protests and even temporary confinement of its field crews. Six months of standby due to constant permit problems and conflicts with NGOs on the block adjacent to Sacha, where PGS Onshore is present, caused another competitor to cease operations.

A geoengineering approach (Corbett 1997) puts aside the traditional discipline groups in favour of concentrated, integrated effort in five cross-disciplinary sub-areas: architecture, properties, modelling, simulation, and management.  In this cross-disciplinary team environment, it is possible to systematically explore various fundamental engineering problems, such as the effect of geological heterogeneity on flow performance; the effect of sandstone architecture on the seismic response; the relative contributions of stress and saturation changes to time-lapse seismic response through; and the well test response to a braided fluvial reservoir. To illustrate aspects of a geonomic approach we consider some of the simplified taxonomic classifications that can be used to map critical parameters in a systematic approach by considering specific cases within a global framework."", 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Reservoir Geonomics - focussing on the essentials of reservoir geological modelling', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': 'N/A', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'N/A'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:13:27.318935', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:13:27.318945'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': '8cfc261e-5a32-4776-8548-06bcd2dcb24d'}}}"

The story of Brazilís sudden change of heart over the virtue of a nationalized oil industry has been fuelled partly by a worldwide turning away from state control. More pertinently there has been growing concern over the country's oil import import bill and the need to increase home production as rapidly as possible, a task regarded as beyond Petrobras. The company was founded in 1953 as a state monopoly of the company's oil industry, upstream and downstream. It inherited from the former National Oil Council oil fields with a capacity to produce 2700 b/d as well as downstream interests in refineries, tankers and the like. Its recoverable reserves of oil were at that time put at 15 million barrels. The company's fortunes and stature in the world industry changed dramatically following the discovery of the Guaroupa field in the Campos Basin in 1974, which put Petrobras on the road to developing some of the most innovative offshore technological projects in the world, setting records for deep water production along the way. By 1981 the Guaroupa, Namorado, Anchova, Pampo and Badejo fields were in production producing over 50% of the countryís oil and gas.

Despite its importance, however, little is known about how sediment flux varies as a function of morphotectonic processes in the source terrain, such as fold and thrust growth, variations in bedrock lithology, drainage pattern changes and temporary sediment storage in intermontane basins. In this study, these factors are explored with a mathematical model of topographic evolution which couples fluvial erosion with fold and thrust kinematics. The model is calibrated by comparing predicted topographic relief with relief measured from a DEM of the Central Zagros Mountains fold belt. The sediment‐flux curve produced by the Zagros fold belt simulation shows a delay between the onset of uplift and the ensuing sediment flux response. This delay is a combination of the natural response time of the geomorphic system and a time lag associated with filling, and then subsequently uplifting and re‐eroding, the proximal part of the basin. Because deformation typically propagates toward the foreland, the latter time lag may be common to many ancient foreland basins. Model results further suggest that the response time of the bedrock fluvial system is a function of rock resistance, of the width of the region subject to uplift and erosion, and, assuming a nonlinear dependence of fluvial erosion upon channel gradient, of uplift rate. The geomorphic response time for the calibrated Zagros model is on the order of a few million years, which is commensurate with, or somewhat larger than, typical recurrence intervals for episodes of thrusting. However, model experiments also highlight the potential for significant variations in both geomorphic response time and in sediment flux as a function of varying rock resistance. Given a reasonable erodibility contrast between resistant and erodible lithologies, model sediment flux curves show significant sediment flux variations that are related solely to changes in rock resistance as the outcrop pattern changes. An additional control on sediment flux to a basin is drainage diversion in response to folding or thrusting, which can produce major shifts in the location and magnitude of sediment source points.

Thus, we suggest that the large‐scale geometry of drainage networks in mountain ranges is mainly antecedent to erosion.

The latter is explored via a model based on the notion that all debris produced by weathering within a drainage basin over any time period is either retained as part of the regolith, transported out of the basin as solid or dissolved sediment yield, or stored as alluvium within the fluvial system. This system is dynamically stable if alluvium is always potentially available for transport; e.g. to be converted to yield, and if regolith development exerts a negative feedback on weathering rates. This supports the argument that the long‐term consistency of sediment yields (where it exists) may be attributable to the storage and remobilization of alluvium, which buffers the system against environmental change.

Furthermore, viable gas shales most likely occur in many developed basins where an underutilized distribution infrastructure exists and markets are readily accessible. Annual natural gas production from shale gas reservoirs in the US is approximately 1.0 Tcf and comes from more than 40,000 shale gas wells (around 6-10% of total natural-gas production in the US today; numbers vary according to reference). While high energy prices and advances in fracturing technology have enabled shale gas production to become a lucrative reality, it is the prediction of gas concentration, partition behaviour and rock properties ahead of drilling that is of paramount importance for reducing risk and identifying “sweet spots” or fairways. In other words, there is still a lot to learn scientifically about how shale gas systems actually work. Significant advances have been made over the last five years, but there are great opportunities for major advances in science and technology. No commercial shale-gas enterprises are currently known from outside of North America. Estimations of more than 16,000 Tcf worldwide shale-gas resources are indications that a tremendous potential exists for future growth.

It consists of dark, carbonaceous lacustrine shale overlain in part by siliciclastic turbidites and tuffs, and was deposited in a sea-level highstand under strongly anoxic redox conditions (Faure and Cole, 1999; Summons et al., 2008). While its organic richness is beyond doubt, thermal maturity will likely play the critical role in distinguishing gas shale versus oil shale potentials. By analogy with the Barnett Shale and Marcellus Shale plays of the United States, advanced thermal maturity levels will be prerequisite in order to achieve high gas-in-place and enable high gas flow rates to be maintained. The role played by the Karoo basalts in defining maturation history is of paramount importance. Extremely high maturity levels (Rm = 2-4%) have already been documented in cores of the Whitehill Formation, and lateral continuity demonstrated by MT surveys (Branch et al., 2007 Inkaba yeAfrica Special Volume). The current contribution will outline the attributes of gas shales in the United States, and explore the potential targets in South Africa, most notably the Whitehill and Prince Albert Formations.', 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Shale Gas: an Unconventional Hydrocarbon Resource in South Africa?

In this method, the opening angle between rays from source and receiver is constrained to make a fixed angle at the image point. Thus, this is a common opening angle migration/inversion, in contrast to the more standard common-offset or common-shot methods. This method has the advantage of dealing more routinely with mulipathing of rays than the latter two methods do. However, integration over dip angle can have some computational disadvantages. We overcome these by recasting the formula as an integral over all sources and receivers, and migrating in parallel to generate a suite of common-opening angle gathers. We show that the transformation of coordinates from image point to surface points leads to an additional amplitude weight involving only geometrical factors and ray-generated factors already required for true amplitude processing. Previous derivations of this method use the theory of generalized Radon theory and pseudo-differential operators/Fourier integral operators, or they use least squares methodology. Thus, our results are not new - although some of the formulas are. Ourderivation here arises from more calssical Kirchhoff modeling and inversion theory, hopefully more accessible to the geophysical community. Further, it demonstrates that this m/i method is an alternative Kirchhoff method for a sorting of the data that is different from common-shot or common-offset. Integrating over dip angle at depth requires easy access to all traces, since the required traces are defined by ray tracing from the image point. Integrating over all sources and receivers eliminates that difficulty.

The main objective of the experiment was to study the characteristic features of plasma bubbles. The rocket reached an apogee altitude of 557km covering a horizontal range of 589km, and passed through several medium scale plasma bubbles mainly during the downleg. The upleg electron density profile showed the presence of a clearly defined base for the F-region around 300km, while the downleg profile showed the presence of a large number of plasma bubbles in this height region as well as in the upper F-region. Electron temperature was estimated by applying a sweep potential varying from –1.5V to +2.5V in about 2.5 seconds, to the Langmuir probe During the rocket upleg the valley between the E-region and the base of the F-region showed abnormally large electron temperatures reaching more than 3000 deg K just below the base of the F-region at 300km. The maximum electron temperature observed above the F-peak was only about 700 deg K close to the rocket apogee. During the downleg of the rocket, the electron temperature exhibited a completely different variation pattern. Relatively larger temperatures were observed inside the plasma bubbles, especially at the topside of the bubbles. Bottomsides of the bubbles were associated with relatively lower electron temperatures. The valley between the E- and F-regions also showed much lower electron temperatures during the rocket downleg compared to the upleg. The region below the base of the F-region seems to be associated with very large electron temperatures just before the development of plasma bubbles as in the present case of the rocket upleg. Once the bubbles develop and start rising up the electron temperature falls down except inside the plasma bubbles as in present case of the rocket downleg.

Seismic images in these environments are often of reduced quality, and new innovative seismic technologies are needed to reduce risk in these settings. Fault and fracture identification is, probably the biggest challenge for the seismic in carbonate and unconventional reservoirs. A major challenge in carbonate environments is to map heterogeneities which have a strong impact on oil and gas production. In many carbonate reservoirs, matrix porosity contains the oil in place but the permeability is mainly provided by fracture corridors. In other reservoirs, the oil in place is found primarily in karstic caves. Even using the most advanced imaging and inversion techniques, it is extremely difficult to identify small faults and characterize the distribution of fractures. Well information can successfully locate faults and provide directional trends of fractures only near the wells. Unfortunately, the reliability of detection small and medium scale (less than the seismic wavelength) heterogeneities and possibility characterize their properties in conventional processing and imaging is generally low. Conventional imaging methods which are biased towards smooth continuous reflectors are intrinsically limited when confronting challenges in detection and delineation of these subsurface elements. Seismic migration treats reflection and diffraction differently (Khaidukov et al., 2004). While diffracted waves are focused to a diffraction point at depth, the wavefront of the extrapolated reflected wave is not focused but is tangent to the reflector. Focusing of the reflection would occur at the imaginary source point. In the migrated section, we see reflectors as an envelope of the secondary fictitious diffraction. As a consequence, interpretation of seismic images is of limited use for the characterization of subsurface singularities and discontinuities. In regular migration and inversion, scattered wavefronts from small scattering objects are usually masked by the stronger reflection energy and noise. Small-scale subsurface elements usually are not included in the estimated velocity model, and they may, therefore, be considered as defects or damaged regions of the velocity model. Information about structural discontinuities and small-scale subsurface elements is coded in diffracted waves, and they can be detected by diffraction imaging (Landa, 2012). Diffraction imaging aims to focus the diffraction energy into its origins, namely, into subsurface discontinuities and local heterogeneities which created the registered diffraction wavefield. The separation between reflective and diffractive components of the total wavefield is at the core of the diffraction imaging.', 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Reducing Exploration and Development Risk by Diffraction Imaging', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': 'Progress’19', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'Sochi, Russia'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:13:18.248479', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:13:18.248490'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': '10b4a06d-0ec4-4bd7-bec1-fce344c7367d'}}}"

Developments over the last 10 years in field procedures and methods of data analysis have greatly increased the utility of this technique in mapping targets in the shallow environment. Nonetheless, two problems associated with hidden layers are often cited as serious shortcomings with the technique, namely mapping the top of the hidden layer and mapping boundaries below the hidden layer. If a hidden layer is not identified in the data, the errors in depth calculations can be significant. Lankston (1989) has demonstrated the use of the general reciprocal method (GM) for recognizing a hidden layer and mapping of boundaries below the layer. Once recognized, the errors in depth calculations are reduced but are still greater than. for problems where a hidden layer does not exist. This reason is often used to justify more costly P-wave reflection surveys. While not routinely applied in shallow investigations, horizontally polarized shear waves can yield additional information. Shear (S) wave velocity is largely dependent on the shear modulus or stiffness of a material and is virtually unaffected by degree of saturation. As a result of the different nature of S-wave propagation, S-waves may often show boundaries not seen in P-wave surveys and equally the P-wave may show boundaries S-waves do not. The combined use of both P and S-wave seismics are described for two site surveys. Lithology logs were available for both sites and the seismics investigation formed part of a more comprehensive geophysical feasibility study. The hidden layer problem is often encountered in shallow unconsolidated sediment/bedrock surveys where ""velocity inversions"" and ""layers too thin"" are common.

Petroleum hydrocarbons were seeping from the south bank of the North Platte River approximately one-half mile west of the Township of Glenrock, Wyoming. Product was moving along the top of the water table through coarse grained sediments and discharging into the river. Initial investigations, resulting in the excavation of three trenches, were unable to determine the source and migration pathways that the hydrocarbons were following. A geophysical survey was performed that provided a map of the subsurface geology that controlled free and dissolved product migration. The geophysical methods used included terrain conductivity, using two instruments that allowed two different coil separations (the Geonics EM-31 and EM-34), and transient electromagnetics (TEM). The portability and data collection efficiency of the EM-31 guided its use as a reconnaissance tool. Data from the EM-31 provided a map of near-surface conductivity patterns indicative of shallow lithologic variation between coarse-grained paleochannel deposits and tine-grained fluvial overbank sediments. Correlation of the EM-31 response with known geology observed in test pit excavations resulted in some concern as to whether the mapped lithologic variation was too shallow to have controlled groundwater migration. To address this, the EM-31 was operated at ground, and at 3 and 7 feet (ft) heights above ground over a high conductivity zone (interpreted to be fine-grained material). Data obtained indicated that the high conductivity material was not a thin surficial veneer, but instead represented finegrained deposits at depths of 0 to greater than 10 ft. The EM-34 instrument was also used at a lo-meter coil separation along selected traverses to confirm the vertical extent of the interpreted lithologic variation. In addition, a profile of central loop TEM sounding provided enough information to allow one-dimensional computer modeling, which provided a quantitative depth extent of fine-grained (fluvial overbank) deposits.

In special directions the phase velocities become degenerate, these singularities prevent the use of linearized inversion schemes (Chapman and Pratt, 1992).

We use the well established relationship that the logarithm of the optimum salinity is a linear function of the equivalent alkane carbon number (EACN) at atmospheric pressure.  The procedure corrects that data for the effect of pressure and methane content in the oil.  We compare our predicted results to all high-pressure data available in the literature.

A similar correction can also be made for the optimum solubilization ratio.  The optimal salinity for live crude is determined from the calculated EACN for the live oil, and the calculated optimum salinity versus EACN relationship at the pressure of interest.

To address this interference, it is necessary to invert for the full set of notional sources for all the source arrays. The estimated far-field signatures at each shot location are then deblended prior to any average or shot-by-shot signature calculation. Furthermore, de-blending the far-field directional signatures requires correct handling of the bubble shot-by-shot variations which are not bandlimited to the signal apparition non-aliased regions.', 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'De-Signature of Apparition Blended Seismic Data', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': '82nd EAGE Annual Conference & Exhibition', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'Amsterdam, The Netherlands'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:13:00.967496', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:13:00.967506'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': 'c0f3d639-6839-4b42-bd96-03d02165be38'}}}"

Viscosity reductions of up to two orders of magnitude may be achieved as a result of CO2 dissolution in heavy oil. However, adverse viscosity ratio which results in viscous fingering and early breakthrough of CO2 is a constraint for application of CO2 injection in heavy oil reservoirs. In addition, in the case of thin reservoirs (horizontal displacement) gravity segregation results in gravity override which further reduces the sweep efficiency. As a result, CO2 injection requires be combining with either water flood or injecting in the form of CO2-foam in order to have acceptable sweep efficiency in viscous and heavy oil reservoirs. In our previous papers, the displacement efficiency in waterflood, CO2 and CO2-foam injection in heavy oil systems under gravity stable condition were investigated. This paper presents the results of a series of coreflood experiments performed to evaluate the potential of water, CO2, CO2SWAG and CO2-foam injection in a heavy oil reservoir under condition of gravity segregation.  This paper presents the results of a series of coreflood experiments performed in order to evaluate the potential of different water and CO2 injection strategies for improving heavy oil recovery. CO2 injection showed great potentials for increasing oil recovery when it was injected in secondary mode and an ultimate recovery of around 45 %IOIP was achieved. Compared to water flood, secondary CO2 injection recovered much more oil especially after breakthrough. Combining CO2 and water injection by simultaneously injecting CO2 and water (CO2SWAG) increased oil recovery more that only water or only CO2 injection. CO2SWAG reduced the CO2 mobility and increased sweep efficiency and a final recovery of 70 %IOIP accomplished. The addition of an appropriate surfactant to the flood water and its co-injection with CO2 resulted in the in-situ formation of CO2-foam which provided better mobility control and resulted in the highest oil recovery amongst the injection strategies tested.

We need new material, or large, exploration opportunities. It has become clear that these will not come from our long-established ventures, but rather from new plays, mostly in geological basins new to Shell. This is driving our strategy away from near-field exploration towards these new plays. So our strategy is to renew our portfolio by screening basins that have the right potential for hydrocarbons, and focusing on these areas. Within a basin we then consider which plays are the best and this will direct our efforts to obtain new acreage. Of course such plays may still be present in our conventional heartlands. This change in strategy towards material discoveries has profound implications for the development and implementation of technologies that will help executing this strategy. This is in particular true for new areas in on-shore areas in the Middle East and Russia including Arctic areas, but also in the high grading of exploration portfolios in Deep Water areas. As a result we have been developing new technical capabilities to screen basins that have the right potential for hydrocarbons, and then focus on these areas. The challenge is to provide optimal technologies that would both allow us to rapidly screen for exploration potential in large on-shore areas, as well as allow for a rapid appraisal and production of newly found discoveries.

Marine controlled-source electromagnetic (CSEM) research began more than 80 years ago with DC surveys off the southwest coast of England by the Schlumberger brothers, but has only emerged in the last five years as a practical tool for oil and gas applications. Many of the theoretical and practical developments needed for this technology came from university and government researchers over the last 25 years (Chave et al., 1991; Constable, 2006). ExxonMobil began research on marine CSEM in 1981, and since 1998 has allocated significant resources to evaluating the potential of this technology (Srnka et al., 2006). The principal strength of marine CSEM data is that they provide new information on subsurface geology independently from the seismic method, although at significantly lower resolution. More than 220 marine CSEM surveys have been acquired worldwide by industry since late 2000 when the first test was conducted offshore Angola by Statoil (Eidesmo et al., 2002; Ellingsrud et al., 2002). Subsequent pre-drill prediction success rates are reported to be generally very avorable throughout the industry. Although the method was seen initially as a “yes/no” technique for indicating hydrocarbon presence in targets previously identified by seismic data, marine CSEM methods are sufficiently flexible that they can be applied to a larger set of geological problems.

Pseudo relative permeabilities which are scaled by the parameter G are shown to have a limited sensitivity to reservoir descriptions for a reasonable variation in reservoir permeabilities. The derivations of the pseudos were based on simulations of several reservoir descriptions simulated at a number of different velocities.

The related costs, mainly as far as the shallow high resolution surveys are concerned, limit an extensive application of it. This is the reason why today research is mainly focussed to a technological improvement so that data could be acquired more and more quickly and with a signal to noise ratio more and more favourable. Although several authors have demonstrated that certain situations could be addressed more effectively through the use of SH-waves rather than the more commonly used P-waves, SH-waves are far from being a widely used exploration tool since they involve higher costs than P-waves. When suitable circumstances occur, and the appropriateness of the method is verified, the key to the successful use of shallow seismic reflection is its cost-effectiveness, that is, a quick data-acquisition and minimal data processing. Usually, SH-wave data acquisition involves the use of polarized sources. SH-wave records require two shots, striking the source in opposite directions perpendicular to the seismic line, which must be subtracted to eliminate P-wave contamination. This means an increase of survey costs with respect to similar P-wave survey. Also, it is common experience that effective P-wave removal requires the equalization and the removal of time break variations of shot records prior to subtraction. This means additional processing time and, as a consequence, additional costs. In order to avoid the above drawbacks we have designed and realized (Sambuelli and Deidda, 1998) a new receiver that enables to acquire SH-wave data without the abovementioned additional costs. Using this receiver, SH-wave records, without or with minimal P-wave contamination, can be achieved performing single shots and avoiding extra processing. Consequently, SH-wave survey can be performed as well as P-wave survey, without involving traditional extra costs. In an attempt to quantify the significant characteristics and field performances of the new receiver, some laboratory (electrical and mechanical) and field (with different acquisition parameter settings) tests with consistent testing procedures and equipment were carried out. Besides, in order to have a comparison between this receiver and the traditional one, all tests were carried out on two sets of receivers: 24 SwyphoneTM type receivers (prototypes) and 24 Mark Product (L-40 A2) 100 Hz horizontal geophones. All results prove that the SwyphoneTM has better performances and so, it is an improvement in SH-wave reflection seismology that could be of great assistance to engineering seismologists. In particular, with respect to traditional geophones, it has a higher sensitivity to SH-waves, higher energy efficiency and allows cost-effectiveness data acquisition and data processing. The higher sensitivity to SH-wave and higher energy efficiency of the SwyphoneTM type receiver, if it is mounted together with a vertical geophone, allow performing P- and SH-wave simultaneous data acquisition.

We have developed and implemented in a commercial reservoir simulator a robust numerical simulation engine that is computationally efficient and stable. The novelty of our approach relies on the flexibility of both spatial and temporal discretization schemes. We solve the parabolic pressure equation with the multiscale finite volume method and the hyperbolic transport equation in the sequential fully implicit scheme. With this framework, we can devise appropriate numerical algorithms accounting for the nonlinearity captured from different spatial scale resolutions and dynamic multi-phase flow transport phenomena respectively. The transport solver utilizes the hybrid upwind discretization, proposed by Lee et al. (2015), to stabilize the numerical convergence difficulty due to the interaction between viscous and gravity flows in the conventional phase potential upwind discretization. Specifically, we split the co-current viscous flow upwinding by total velocity direction and the counter-current gravity flow upwinding by phase density differences. This eliminates the discontinuity of the numerical flow in the transition from co-current to counter-current flows and guarantees the differentiable flow functions. Additionally, the Newton updates are safeguarded by the numerical trust region analysis previously proposed by Li and Tchelepi (2014) and further extended to the general three phase condition with a parameterization of the flow function derivatives along the solution direction.

The scheme uses the reflection data as acquired at the surface as input, together with an estimate of the direct arrival from the surface to location F, which is referred to as the initial focusing function. We interpret the overall action of the scheme as the successive actions of various linear filters, acting on the initial focusing function. These filters involve multidimensional crosscorrelations with the reflection response, time reversals and truncations in time. Inspired by literature on seismic interferometry, we interpret multidimensional crosscorrelation in terms of the subtraction of traveltimes along stationary raypaths. The scheme has been designed for layered media with smooth interfaces. Our interferometric interpretation reveals some of the scheme s limitations when it is applied to more complex configurations. It can be concluded that (downgoing or upgoing) internal multiples that arrive at F with a particular angle can be retrieved only if the initial focusing function (i.e., the direct wave) has visited F with this angle. Consequently, shadow zones that cannot be imaged with primary reflections can theoretically also not be imaged with internal multiples, when the current iterative scheme is used for their retrieval. Finally, we observe that the current scheme does not yet optimally perform in media with point scatterers, since an underlying assumption (generally referred to as the ansatz) is not perfectly obeyed in this case.

Most of these models performed a 1.6 to 4.7-fold increased reservoir filtration proprieties.

Undesirable effect was due to the partial dissolution of some rock fabric constituents such as opal and chalcedony by HCl and HF. Acid treatment involves also surface activation, which results in increased amount of the mineral-bound water and, consequently, in decreasing rock permeability. This requires stabilization of swellable clay minerals. For this purpose, the treatment of reservoir rocks from northern Saharan fields with calcium chloride performed increase of reservoir filtration capacity for two- or even three-fold. The repeated treatment has not produced a substantial increase of the permeability. The favourable effect of CaCl2 treatment is plausibly explained by the change of the film thickness of bound water in the pore space as well as by the replacement of Na+ cations by Ca2+ cations in swellable clay minerals. This process promotes also the dehydration of sandstone clay cement and desorption of asphaltenes and resins in the stratum. The treatment of the argillaceous cement of sandstone in the reservoir with KCl, HCl and CaCl2 solutions produced decrease in clay swelling by 10 to 50 %.

In order to support Qatar Shell with the execution of onshore and offshore seismic programs, satellite imagery was used extensively to derive added value products in terms of shallow water bathymetry, seabed classification and onshore digital elevation models (DEM). For the offshore bathymetry and seabed classification products, 2m resolution multispectral WorldView-2 satellite scenes were processed following a data processing chain including the correction of atmospheric adjacency (increased radiance over water due to reflection of photons by the nearby land and their further scattering in the atmosphere), water surface and water column effects. The resulting offshore products had a spatial resolution of 4m and covered an area of ~700 km2. For the onshore elevation product, a 50cm WorldView-1 stereo image pair was processed using a photogrammetric stereo vision algorithm to generate a 1m spatial resolution DEM over an area of ~450 km2. The accuracy and quality of these satellite image derived products depend largely on the optical conditions of the satellite scene, the sensitivity of the satellite sensor and the accuracy of the calibration. Three types of independent control datasets were used to assess the quality and accuracy of the bathymetry and DEM; airborne LiDAR sounding transects, multibeam echo sounding swaths (offshore) and seismic survey lines (onshore and offshore). After correction for any systematic bias, the correlation of both products with the control data was found to be very good with <1m vertical error in general. Satellite image products are recognized within QSUI as a key technology to aid the planning and preparation of seismic operations and site evaluation by improving hazard identification and reducing field risk exposure early on in the project life cycle. In addition, cost savings were realized compared to more costly traditional acquisition methods. The seismic field conditions were assessed relatively quickly compared to the time frame required for traditional methods.

This paper presents a novel methodology for core characterization and SCAL sample selection. SCAL data is used as input for spatial distribution of reservoir properties in a static reservoir model. The analysis is performed in siliciclastics and carbonate reservoirs from wells in the Bahrah Oil Field.

The high resolution 3D CT images improved the sedimentological descriptions of the core and the X-ray CT-derived numerical data (BD and Zeff) are used to derive porosity and mineralogy along the whole core sections. This information is then converted into lithology logs which predicted the cross-well correlation and enhanced the previously established correlation from conventional core descriptions.

Porosity is a critical volumetric parameter used to estimate the reserve for a given reservoir and it can be used as an input for reservoir simulation as well. In addition, porosity can be classified into two types, effective porosity (interconnected pores) and total porosity (connected and isolated pores). Total porosity is defined as the sum of effective porosity and clay bound water (CBW). In other words, total porosity obtained from conventional logging tools will be equal to effective porosity in the absence of clay and while it is not the case when clay is present. There are several methods used to estimate porosity of the formation. These include: measuring actual porosity in the core laboratory, computerized tomography (CT) scan, neutron-density logging, sonic tools, and NMR logging tools. All conventional logging tools (neutron-density and sonic logging tools) are strongly dependent on lithology, whereas NMR logging tool is independent of lithology. The NMR logging the most accurate compared to all other methods since it is independent of the reservoir lithology. It can be used to estimate the reservoir porosity directly without the knowledge of matrix lithology. On the other hand, conventional logging such as neutron-density and acoustic depend strongly on lithology which might yield incorrect porosity measurement. Several studies have been conducted to estimate porosity for both sandstone and carbonate reservoirs using different logging tools, however, determining porosity is a challenge in 2 IPTC 17260 complex and unconventional lithologies. In sandstone, the presence of shale and clay minerals will affect the response of all porosity tools. Carbonate is even more complicated than sandstone due to its heterogeneity and triple porosity system (pores, vugs, and fractures). In addition, the assessment of porosity measurements accuracy using NMR logging will be considered in this study. An attempt will be made to develop an empirical correlation from NMR data to obtain reliable porosity estimation.

Despite its common occurrence there is: 1) Wide variation in its definition, 2) Uncertainty around characterization, genetic controls, and distribution 3) A rudimentary understanding of its influence on reservoir performance and hydrocarbon recovery. The results of this study, based on a global survey of microporosity and specific Middle Eastern case studies, provide clarity on each of these topics. One volumetrically significant type of microporosity occurs between micron size subhedral crystals of low magnesium calcite in matrix and within grains. This micro-pore system is very homogenous in terms of pore size distribution with 90% of pores between 1 and 3 microns in diameter. Pore throat radii range between 0.1 and 1.5 microns. Porosity, permeability, and capillarity relationships reflect this homogeneity for rocks dominated by microporosity. Rocks with less than approximately 80% microporosity exhibit a marked increase in pore system heterogeneity. A pore geometry characterization approach incorporating digital image analyses of petrographic thin-sections was developed and provides a very effective means of rapidly characterizing and quantifying the total pore system, including microporosity. The lateral and stratigraphic distribution of microporosity is systematically related to the distribution of depositional facies and the regional extent of burial diagenetic processes. Factors that inhibit burial diagenesis, such as hydrocarbon charge, also have a strong influence on the nature and distribution of microporosity. Remaining oil saturation in microporous limestone, as measured from centrifuge capillary pressure and steady state (SS) core flood experiments, is negatively correlated with the percent fraction of microporosity. Due to the homogenous nature of the micro-pore system, rocks dominated by microporosity have more favorable oil recovery than rocks with mixed pore systems. In the specific cases studied here, water provides more favorable recovery than gas.

In order to optimize casing setting depths in a narrow margin HPHT drilling environment, dynamic flow checks and dynamic formation integrity tests using managed pressure drilling technology were used to define the lower and upper boundaries. The dynamic well control simulations take an influx followed by standard well control procedure of shutting down the pumps and closing the BOP before circulating out the influx. The kick tolerance of a well is governed by fracture pressures, influx volumes and kick intensity. The kick tolerance limits are defined by the operator and if the limits are reached the next casing has to be installed before drilling can proceed.

The simplicity coupled with realistic multiphase technology permits simulations to be performed as soon as an influx is taken.

First, the non-linear and multi-modal statistical petrophysical relationship between acoustic impedance and reservoir porosity is established using collocated geophysical log data. Second, a conventional least-squares post-stack inversion of the impedance is computed on the seismic grid. The fit between well log data and numerically computed traces was found to be inaccurate. This leads to the third step, involving a post-stack stochastic impedance inversion using the same seismic traces to improve well and trace fit, but also to estimate the uncertainty on the inverted impedances. Finally, a Bayesian simulation algorithm adapted to the estimation of a multi-modal porosity distribution is used to simulate realizations of porosity over the entire seismic grid. Results show that the over-smoothing effect of least-squares inversion has a major impact on resource evaluation, especially by not reproducing the high-valued tail of the porosity distribution.

General current understanding of the CO2 distribution in the basin are CO2 percentage increases with depth and high percentage CO2 accumulation are of inorganic origin and tend to be associated with structures with deep seated faults to facilitate CO2 migration up dip from basement. However, we observe that CO2 percentage varies vertically in a field and does not necessarily increases with depth and could also decreases with depth. CO2 of same basement origin are present in different reservoirs of a field; and yet one reservoir may have very low CO2 compared to the other reservoirs. Therefore depth of accumulation and origin of CO2 does not influence the percentage distribution. Geology of traps dictates how much CO2 the container can hold. In closures with good lateral and top seal, high relief structures will accumulate higher percentage CO2 as compared to low relief structures.', 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Carbon Dioxide (CO2) Distribution in the Malay Basin, Malaysia', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': 'PGCE 2005', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:48.017553', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:48.017565'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': 'e562890b-f8f5-4910-9f85-e44ec5d2786f'}}}"

Discontinuity quantifies the degree to which a seismic trace differs from its neighbors, and identifies breaks in the continuity of seismic reflections that are due to faults, diapers, channels, stratigraphic pinchouts, processing artifacts, or noise. Discontinuity attributes have become essential aids in the interpretation of seismic data for structure as well as stratigraphy. Though continuity computations have a long history in seismic data processing, it was only in 1995 when the first practical discontinuity (or continuity or coherence) attribute was introduced for 3D seismic data interpretation. The original discontinuity method employed two orthogonal cross-correlations with a 3 trace operator. Other methods soon appeared based on semblance, covariance, and image processing edge detection. Enthusiastic claims have been made for the superiority of one particular method over competing methods, but the differences between them owe as much or more to algorithmic details as to fundamentals of the discontinuity computation. In particular, the analysis window size and shape has a large influence on both the quality of the attribute and the computation time. For the same analysis window, methods based on correlation, semblance, principal components, and weighted correlation produce discontinuity attributes that are often indistinguishable. This is not surprising, as these common methods all treat discontinuity as a ratio of discontinuous energy to total energy, and differ only in how they define discontinuous energy. Most methods for discontinuity computation implicitly assume flat data and so tend to perform poorly in areas of steep dip. The standard solution is to determine the dominant dip in the analysis window first, and then to compute discontinuity along this dominant dip. This step often involves considerably more effort than the discontinuity computation itself. While it successfully reduces noise in the discontinuity attributes caused by reflection dip, it also degrades the imaging of small discontinuities to the extent that these discontinuities influence the dip estimation. Nonlinear methods show promise for better estimating the reflection dip in the presence of faults and other discontinuities, but their computational cost is so much greater that at present they are often impractical for routine application. Current efforts to improve discontinuity attributes involve either pre-processing of the seismic data to better condition it for attribute computations, or post-processing of the discontinuity attributes themselves. The methods used are primarily 2D and 3D filters that remove noise and sharpen the seismic data or discontinuity attribute. Postprocessing methods are general in that they can be applied to any discontinuity attribute, though they may be tailored to enhance fault or stratigraphic discontinuities at the expense of other discontinuities. Computationally inexpensive 2D image processing techniques, such as Laplacian operators or Kuwahara filters applied along time slices or along the reflection dip are effective at enhancing the resolution of discontinuity attributes, though they may perform poorly on standard seismic data. Three-dimensional filters employing principal component analysis or some other transform method are more powerful and produce superior results, but require much more computation time. Post-processing with 3D filters is likely to yield the greatest improvement in discontinuity attributes in the near future.', 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Improving Seismic Discontinuity Attributes', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': 'PGCE 2006', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:47.845786', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:47.845796'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': '76936c0f-a844-4ae6-8eb0-072231293050'}}}"

So far most of the wells drilled in the East Sabah Basin were focused on the northern part of the Sandakan sub-basin, targeting the obvious Middle-Upper Miocene deltaic play within structural closures. Some oil and gas were discovered so far with none of the fields developed yet. The paper will focus on the whole of the East Sabah basin which includes the Sandakan sub-basin and Sabah Trough. Within the Sandakan basin, the untested plays include the stratigraphic traps of turbidite sands which include slope fans and basin floor fans. These new plays are currently identified by only 2D seismic data. The only well drilled close to these play is Gem Reef-1 which encountered gas shows in these similar sands which pinch out onto a volcanic high. But the well was not positioned in the best location to test these sands. Hence these new plays present the new exploration opportunities. One well was drilled in the South Dent Trough but did not encounter any hydrocarbons. The main reasons are the questionable structural closure due to the poor velocity control, poorly defined trap due to poor data quality and the absence of the reservoirs. The well is located up-dip in a slope setting thus not much reservoir development is expected. The sand development should be better downdip in the basin floor fan setting. Acquisition and processing of new, high quality regional seismic data over the eastern and southern parts of the East Sabah basin were carried out in 1999 and 2004. The objective is to upgrade the prospectivity of this exploration-neglected area. Coupled with regional geological study in the East Sabah Basin, the interpretation of these newly acquired seismic data has unraveled new, untested exploration plays, which include both structural and stratigraphic plays. The deep Middle Miocene structural play with 4-way dip closures is observed within the southeastern margin of the Sandakan sub-basin. These structures were generated during the Pliocene uplift together with the creation of the onshore Dent Anticlinorium. This structural trend is expected to continue in the Dent onshore area but at shallower level. The deep Middle-Upper Miocene turbidite play, determined by seismic facies analysis and amplitude extraction, is located in the eastern portion of the South Dent Trough. The delineation of this play, expressed by the gently mounded seismic facies, can be further enhanced by 3D seismic coverage. Finally, the Middle Miocene pinnacle reef play, clearly imaged by the new seismic data as mounded facies, is present in the central area of the South Dent Trough.

The ability of the 3D models to describe realistic structural and stratigraphic geometries. 2. The integration of data from a wide variety of sources including; well, seismic and production data.  MODELLING REALISTIC GEOMETRIES 3D structural modelling of large and complex fields has remained a bottleneck in the 3D reservoir modelling workflow. Nevertheless there have been large improvements in the ability of modelling algorithms to describe complex structural geometries in strongly extensional and compressional regimes, and around salt domes. Many of these advances required a major concept change from describing faults using pillars to a less constrained pillar-free representation in the 3D model. Modelling of realistic stratigraphic architecture has also seen significant advances in recent years due to enhancement of object modelling algorithms and the introduction of “Multi-Point” Statics (MPS). There is still a need however for further development of facies modelling algorithms to capture realistic depositional and diagenetic geometries. Outcrop analogues should be used more actively for designing realistic algorithms and for constraining the input parameters to the models. DATA INTEGRATION One of the main aims of 3D modelling is to utilise all available data and interpretations in a consistent manner. Recent developments have seen much improved use of horizontal well data in the structural model construction, and increasing application of seismic data in property modelling. Two important integration themes are still in their infancy and are receiving increased focus. The first involves the incorporation of 4D seismic feedback into the static and dynamic models. The second involves the active use of dynamic (history) data in the static model (“the Big Loop”). The integration of these data types will become more commonplace during the next few years and will contribute to improved 3D reservoir models and subsequently to better reservoir management of “Challenging Discoveries”.', 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Recent Developments and Future Challenges in 3D Reservoir Modelling', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': 'PGCE 2010', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:46.499998', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:46.500011'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': '5228b4ad-dee8-437d-9d3f-2a4aad0e18e8'}}}"

As with many fields with large structures located in the central axis of the Malay basin, the field under study in this paper is also beset with this issue. This field, which is currently in the development stage, is a 30km long by 10km wide E-W trending elongated four way dip closure intersected by N-S & E-W striking normal faults. Two main structural culminations can be observed on the field. The major culmination lies to the eastern side of the field while a smaller one lies to the western side. The field is found to contain both oil and gas accumulation. A marine streamer 3D seismic survey was acquired over the field in 2002. The survey was acquired with an E-W line orientation. This 3D survey data was originally processed using Pre-Stack Time Migration (PSTM) in 2002. Amplitude and frequency attenuation of reflectors were particularly severe on the two crestal culminations from approximately 800ms onwards. This problem was attributed to the presence of shallow gas and is further compounded by the presence of multiply stacked gas zones below the shallow gas. As a result, a number of key problems were inherent in the dataset, namely depth uncertainties especially at the crestal zones, fault imaging uncertainties within the gas cloud and also vertical resolution issues. The 2002 dataset was reprocessed using Pre-Stack Depth Migration (PSDM) in 2009. The aim of this exercise was to improve seismic imaging within the gas cloud, to improve vertical resolution via increased sampling rate, to increase the signal to noise ratio via new processing technologies such as SRME & model based Q and also to reduce depth uncertainty by deriving a high resolution velocity model representative of the changes in geology. Overall, the PSDM data did demonstrate improvements in terms of reflector continuity and frequency content within the gas cloud area. Fault imaging uncertainty, even though still present, has also improved as the fault interpretation within the gas cloud was carried out with greater confidence. Depth prediction at wells based on the PSDM has also shown improvements over the PSTM based prediction. Despite these improvements, the fundamental uncertainties in the dataset remain present as they were inherent to the acquisition process itself. Also in 2009, a 4-Component Ocean Bottom Cable (4COBC) test line was acquired over the gas cloud zone on the eastern culmination of the field. This operation was carried out to demonstrate two key points. The first was to demonstrate the feasibility of carrying out an OBC acquisition in the studied field while the second and more important point was to demonstrate the data quality improvements of the OBC data over conventional streamer data. The 4COBC test line was acquired in a N-S orientation as opposed to the E-W orientation of the streamer acquisition with the intention to undershoot the gas cloud, and thus give better imaging. Preliminary results from the 4COBC data has shown marked improvements over the streamer data on the particular test line in all imaging and structural aspects which were noted earlier. These results suggest that 4COBC seismic acquisition is feasible in this field and is probably the methodology that will give the best imaging of the field under today s technology. In summary, this paper has demonstrated that the 2009 PSDM has managed to improve the seismic data processed via PSTM in 2002. However, the problems faced by the 2002 PSTM attributed to shallow gas cloud are still present in the 2009 PSDM dataset as they are inherent to the acquisition process. In order to break away from these problems, a 4COBC survey may be the way to go.

We will describe how to select the different attributes to produce a meta-attribute (hybrid attribute) and how to use THESE META-ATTRIBUTES to map the reservoir property.

The obtained data were combined with the geological-geophysical information into the geoinformation system for further processing and analysis. GIS technologies allows integrating all the variety of available data on the structures into a uniform system and enables carrying out of researches in the view of all possible data (DeMers Michael, 1999). The work used space images taken by satellites Landsat-7, which provided imaging of the Earth s surface with application of six channels with resolution 30 meters, and one IR-channel with the resolution 60 meters with simultaneous panochromatic imaging with resolution 15 m. The width of the review for all channels made 185 km. The data were geopositioned in Gauss-Kruger projection on Krasovsky ellipsoid in the system of coordinates SK-42, the tenth zone. Then rectilinear sites (lineaments) were determined by the elements of landscape. Lineaments are generally understood as linear heterogeneities of the earth's crust and lithosphere. They can be of a various rank, extent and depth. They can develop on surface directly or as geological and landscape anomalies. Lineaments are caused by latent breaks of basement, fracture zones in sediments, etc. Lineaments and lineament zones are zones (channels) of the raised permeability of the Earth's crust. They serve as transiting ways for solutions and gases, which generally possess higher temperature in comparison to the surface of the Earth (Kats Y.G., 1986). Also in fracture zones, especially sedimentary basins, the fluid system is constantly present and redistributed. It results in intensive deformations in fracture zones, and, hence, in their expression in the landscape attributes reflected on space images in the form of lineaments (Kuzmin Y.O., 2004). Therefore, the shape of lineaments on space images is a generalized reflection on the surface of both deformations and fluid mode of near-surface areas of the Earth's crust. Lineaments are possible to divide into several types by their extent: transcontinental, transregional, regional, local. Lineaments, resulted from various discontinuous dislocations, have characteristic features. Faults result from stretching of the Earth's crust, incline toward deeper rocks. Lineaments, formed by the given type of dislocation, are characterized by linearity, frequently with offsets, which divide blocks with various geological structure and type of relief. Thrusts are a little bent, round and formed as a result of literal compression. Shears are characterized by horizontal displacement of rocks. Lineaments near them are developed along unidirectional curvatures of riverbeds, slopes, watersheds and other various forms of relief. Overthrusts are resulted from longitudinal compression with formation of folds. Lineaments in this case are developed in the form of complex scalloped pattern of displaced masses. The form of the lineaments, their pattern can help to define kinematic and geodynamic conditions of formations of faults and conditions of their formation. The intensity and width of lineaments depend on the depth of occurrence of a fault and its activity. The account of all these data by the form, sizes, intensity allows  considering faults and geodynamic conditions of the studied area."", 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Analysis of Stress Condition of Faults in Oil-Gas-Bearing Areas Using GIS and Remote Sensing Data', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': 'PGCE 2011', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:45.721959', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:45.721971'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': 'cd2f31df-39d6-4d90-b2c0-63e32f9508e1'}}}"

We demonstrate that accurate identification of key multiple generators is an important first step in applying IMA and describe a vertical seismic profile (VSP) deconvolution technique that may be helpful in analyzing multiple-generation mechanisms. Based on this analysis, we apply both post-stack (1-D) and pre-stack (1.5-D) multiple attenuation. In the case of prestack multiple attenuation, we address the data regularization procedures necessary to reconstruct the regularly and densely sampled common mid-point (CMP) gathers that are required for successful application of IMA.

With these superior characteristics the recorded seismic data not only provide a better structural image of the subsurface geology, they also allow for a more reliable computation of rock parameters and pore fluids. The combination with Sercel s new Nautilus System for integrated navigation and streamer positioning helps to more reliably record weak 4-D signals in reservoir monitor surveys. The solid cables also reduce risks to the environment, since they are not filled with oil. The second development is wideazimuth acquisition, which yields a better image of complex geological structures. Some of the geophysical and operational experience will be presented. It allows for true 3-D processing like 3-D attenuation of multiples and multiple diffractions and derivation of fractures and their orientations. An efficient dual depth acquisition geometry is being introduced yielding extra enhancement of the lower frequencies. The third development is the application of feasibility studies to determine the optimal acquisition geometry for meeting the survey s objectives.

A general review of reservoir connectivity reveals significant differences among companies and academics regarding its definition, measurement, modeling and action. However, most agree that connectivity depends on a field s structural framework, stratigraphy and fluid characteristics. We approach reservoir connectivity by first defining two types: static and dynamic. Static connectivity refers to the original state of a field, prior to production start-up. Evaluation of static connectivity is the basis for proper assessment of original hydrocarbons- in-place and prediction of fluid contacts in untested compartments. Dynamic connectivity describes movement of fluids in response to production. Initiation of production perturbs original fluid distributions, as pressure and saturation changes propagate in a complex fashion across field compartments. Barriers and baffles play varying roles over field life, becoming more-or-less  important over time, suggesting that compartment boundary is itself a dynamic designation. Analysis of dynamic connectivity is essential to estimating ultimate recovery. Our technology called reservoir connectivity analysis (RCA) investigates static field compartments and associated connections. We define a static compartment as a trap with no internal boundaries (e.g. faults, channel margins) so that over geologic time, it can develop only one gas-oil and/or one oil-water contact. Connections between compartments include fault juxtaposition windows and erosional scours between channels. Examples of RCA application and its impact on our fields are discussed.

A 4-D feasibility modeling study was undertaken to predict the 4-D seismic response from water saturation and pressure changes between 2001 and possible monitor  surveys in 2008 and 2015. Full-field 4-D modeling consisted of: (1) determining petrophysical relationships from well logs and core analysis; (2) applying those relationships to the geologic and reservoir simulation models to create a 4- D seismic property model; (3) generating synthetic 4-D datasets for each timestep; (4) adding appropriate levels of 4-D noise; and (5) extracting attributes to determine the interpretability of the predicted 4-D response.

In this project, time-lapse crosswell EM surveys are used to monitor saturation changes in a water injection pilot in the basal low-reservoir quality units of a giant carbonate field in the Middle East. We demonstrate how EM results were used with seismic-derived structural information, geological data, structural models, time-lapse cased hole logs, pressure transient and production data to improve reservoir characterization and dynamic modeling. The evolution of water saturation is derived from measured resistivity distributions, which are obtained by inversion of the EM measurements with respect to an initial resistivity model. To obtain a detailed image of saturation changes, this model must incorporate realistic representations of the small-scale heterogeneities common to carbonate reservoirs. These include layer thickness variations and the presence of thin dense layers interbedded in some reservoir units. Such details allowed improvements in the quality and resolution of the EM results, leading to a better understanding of the reservoir architecture and the behavior of the water flooding process. Preliminary simulation results using simplified models predicted high vertical sweep across the reservoir units, without encountering any flow barriers. This was inconsistent with the EM results, which show that the injected water stays confined within the lower reservoir units, and the measured injection pressures and flow volumes, which were different from those predicted from simulation. Successive adjustments were therefore applied on the dynamic model to honor the EM and injection pressure results. Adjusting the permeability contrast across some layers prevents the upward movement of the injected water, and is consistent with geological interpretation of continuous stylolitic dense layers within the lower reservoir. In addition, fracture corridors, identified on seismic attributes and supported by PLT data and field-wide review of borehole image logs, are used to account for the injected volume mismatch, yielding the correct injection pressure.

The conventional core analysis study included porosity and permeability measurements on plugs samples, MICP, core description, and a reservoir characterization study. Different type of conventional core data were collected, evaluated and incorporated in this study. The study was performed in order to define depositional environment, facies, and the distribution of reservoir rock types. This data was then used to define the flow units which are the building block for a 3D geological model. Limestone reservoir samples are highly complex and reservoir quality is controlled by the presence of mud and the amount of diagenesis. In addition, dissolution of semi-stable biogenic components, such as stromatoporoids, is creating vuggy porosity. This raises the question: Does a plug sample of the reservoir reflect the petrophysical characteristics of the reservoir and its flow performance? The CCA study was performed on 1.5 inch plugs (historic data) and 2.5 inch plugs (more recent data). Sampling often avoids vuggy, fractured and highly cemented areas of the core. The studied field is faulted and reservoir quality might be affected by late stage diagenesis. In addition, certain reservoir facies, such as stromatoporoid build-ups exhibit large-scale vuggy porosity. So, plugs are often not the best sampling technique to represent the reservoir in order to determine petrophysical characteristics and ultimately the flow performance. Whole core samples which are representing different lithofacies types were selected from 2 wells to measure porosity & permeability and conduct CT scans. The whole core data will be used to generate a relationship with plug-size data to allow upscaling the permeability to be consistent with the dynamic well flow test data while maintaining the vertical contrast of permeability, which crucial in characterizing the flow dynamics of stratified reservoir.

For example, in a carbonate reservoir, a direct reading of Magnesium weight percentage provides a valuable measurement of Dolomite volume.

A well known effect of attenuation is the change in frequency content and amplitude of a pulse propagating through an attenuating medium. Another is the presence of frequency dependent reflection coefficients. In viscoelastic media, frequency dependent reflection coefficients bring seismic energy dispersion of wave propagation, especially in seismic exploration where the attenuation is mainly due to the fluid content of the considered media. For the wave propagation in gas reservoirs, even no contrast in acoustic impedance, there is a reflection coefficient depending on the reflectivity dispersion. But most reflection coefficient equations cannot explain the above phenomena. Based on linear viscoelastic theory of velocity dispersion and the linearization of Zoeppritz equations, a new approximate reflection coefficient Rf is presented, which is pore fluid related and adds the effects of frequencies and quality factors. With Rf, the reflected energy change induced by reflectivity dispersion can be calculated and used to directly detect fluid. In our work, this method has been successfully applied to characterize the distribution of tight gas sands in a Triassic clastic sedimentary basin of southwest China. And the results can offer reliable foundations for well designing.', 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Reflectivity Dispersion for Gas Detection', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': 'EAGE Workshop on Seismic Attenuation', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'Singapore, Singapore'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:39.681153', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:39.681165'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': '36d262a1-4bce-4571-8e85-9b090f7b019f'}}}"

These data contain very detailed information on a short scale. However, since the next step in the geo-steering of a borehole always depends on the previous one, the location errors accumulate and, as the drilling acquisition goes further and deeper, the uncertainty of the position and hence the borehole measurements also grows. To image the subsurface and estimate the errors involved in the data analysis process, we perform seismic inversion combining different sources of uncertain measurements, such as uncertain seismic data as well as uncertain well positions and well-log data. This paper presents a new method to incorporate these different sources of uncertainties and on different scales. We simulated various realizations of the subsurface and, taking into account the growing uncertain position of the well location, we could observe the variability that the errors create. As a result, the computed subsurface model and its error estimates are more realistic, and can better guide and optimise future drilling operations.', 'doc_text_translated': None, 'translations': {}, 'other_tags': None, 'bbox': {}, 'remarks': {'TITLE': 'Quantification of errors in well-trace positions and uncertain measurements for improvement of subsurface imaging', 'CONFERENCE_NAME': 'EAGE Subsurface Intelligence Workshop', 'CONFERENCE_LOCATION': 'Manama, Bahrain'}, 'is_cli': False, 'created_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:39.575181', 'updated_at': '2021-06-07T23:12:39.575194'}","{'pdf_file': {'data': None}, 'file': {'data': {'type': 'Files', 'id': '14b0e724-a9f9-4258-b908-8a91912f1978'}}}"
